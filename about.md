We need physical and math workouts, and we need take down the problems we have done. This is my workout page for math, in almost daily updating.

It used to be a section of my OneNote notes but I need share it easily with the people when necessary, especially with Brady and Justina.

Github pages is a good platform to settle down with. [Typora](https://typora.io/) is used for typing the math contents for its great image pasting, and vscode is used for general editing. It's pity that vscode cannot preview all Latex contents sometimes.

[Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/classic?lang=en) is used for all graph editing. Desktop version of Geogebra is also used since it has more keyboard shortcuts that web version in browser.

GitLab with Hugo SSG was given a try but there was some path issue for CSS. Wordpress is a good match with local [Boostnote](https://boostnote.io/) editor but it needs business plan to install Latex plugin on wordpress.com. Both of them were given up.

Jekyll is old and huge with ruby installation but it is clear and easy to start with, and [Jekyll-TeXt theme](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme) is cool.

More technical details are accumulated in [About Jekyll Doc and My Notes]({% post_url 2020-11-11-jekyll-doc-and-my-notes %}).

That's all about it so far.
