We need physical and math workouts, and need take down the problems that have been done. This is my workout blog for math, and it used to be a section of OneNote notes but sharing easily with people is needed especially with Brady and Justina when necessary.

Github pages is a good platform to settle down with. GitLab with Hugo SSG was given a try but there was some path issue for CSS. Wordpress is a good match with local [Boostnote](https://boostnote.io/) editor but business plan is needed to install Latex plugin on wordpress.com. So both GitLab and Wordpress were given up.

Jekyll is old and huge with ruby installation but it is clear and easy to start with. [Jekyll-TeXt theme](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme) is cool with lots of features.

[Typora](https://typora.io/) is used for typing the math contents with its great image pasting, and vscode is used for general editing. Desktop version of [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/classic?lang=en) is used for static graphs for more keyboard shortcuts that web version in browser (but printing only works in web). Plan to add animation gifs with [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/).

More technical details are accumulated in the Blog Tech Notes.
