We need physical and math workouts, and it's better to take down the solved problems. Besides of that, it's cool to follow what math problems or puzzles people solve on popular social media and follow some active accounts on it. Even if we cannot afford solving all of them by ourselves, it's still great to collect the problems and solutions, especially some great approaches. This used to be part of my OneNote but now easy sharing with people is necessary, especially with BüèÄ and Jüêï.

Github pages is a good platform to settle down with. GitLab with Hugo SSG was given a try but there was some path issue for CSS. Wordpress is a charming match with local [Boostnote](https://boostnote.io/) editor but business plan is needed to install Latex plugin on wordpress.com. So both GitLab and Wordpress were given up.

Jekyll is old and huge with ruby installation but it is clear and easy to start with. [Jekyll-TeXt theme](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme) is cool with lots of features.

[Typora](https://typora.io/) is used for typing the math contents with its great image pasting, and vscode is used for general editing. Desktop version of [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/classic?lang=en) is used for static graphs for more keyboard shortcuts that web version in browser (but printing only works in web). Plan to add animation gifs with [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/).

More technical details are accumulated in the blog tech notes.
