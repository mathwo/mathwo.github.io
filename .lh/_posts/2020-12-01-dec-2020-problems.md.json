(AMC 10 2012-B Problem 15)\n+\n+**Solution:**\n+\n+There are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ games played, so it's impossible for 6 teams to win equal number of games.

A blood test is available for screening for this disease. For a person who has this disease, the test always turns out positive. For a person who does not have the disease, however, there is a $2%$ false positive rateâ€”in other words, for such people, $98%$ of the time the test will turn out negative, but $2%$ of the time the test will turn out positive and will incorrectly indicate that the person has the disease. Let $p$ be the probability that a person who is chosen at random from this population and gets a positive test result actually has the disease.
