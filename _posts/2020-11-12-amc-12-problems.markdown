#### Distinct plans $p_1, p_2, ... p_k$ intersect the interior of a cube $Q$, let $S$ be the union of the faces of $Q$ and let $P=\bigcup_{j=1}^{k}{p_j}$. The intersection of $P$ and $S$ consists of the union of all segments joining the midpoints of every pair of edges belonging to the same face of $Q$. What is the difference between the maximum and minimum possible values of $k$?
