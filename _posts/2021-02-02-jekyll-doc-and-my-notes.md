#### Resolve rake version due to security risk

```
Dependabot can't update vulnerable dependencies without a lockfile
The currently installed version can't be determined.

To resolve the issue add a supported lockfile (Gemfile.lock or gems.locked).

View logs or learn more about troubleshooting Dependabot errors.

Always verify the validity and compatibility of suggestions with your codebase.
