#### Godel's Incompleteness Theorems

I found this is a favorite topic to Indians, not sure why.

##### Interesting Quotes

> - Arithmetical truth cannot be defined in arithmetic -- Alfred Tarski
> - Incompleteness theorem only applies to axiomatic systems, and English language is not an axiomatic system.

#### [Testing divisibility by 7, 11, and 13](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/11/10/test-for-divisibility-by-13/)

$10^3 \equiv \text{ -1 mod 1001 } \implies \displaystyle \sum_{i=0}^{n}{a_i \cdot 10^{3i}} \equiv \displaystyle \sum_{i=0}^{n}{(-1)^{i}a_i} \text{ mod 1001}$

> The heart of the method is that $7 \times 11 \times 13 = 1001$. If I subtract a multiple of 1001 from a number, I don’t change its divisibility by 7, 11, or 13. More than that, I don’t change its remainder by 7, 11, or 13.

#### [Testing for divisibility by 19](https://blog.plover.com/math/divisibility-by-19.html)

> Double the last digit and add the next-to-last. Double that and add the next digit over. Repeat until you've added the leftmost digit. The result will be a smaller number which has the same mod-19 residue.

Actually [this page](https://brilliant.org/wiki/divisibility-rules/) and [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisibility_rule#Divisibility_rules_for_numbers_1%E2%80%9330) mentions these rules.

> If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up people together to collect wood and don’t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.

[Quote Investigator](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/08/25/sea/)

Actually, if you want to people know how to build a ship and long for the sea, then you need build a blog first.
