#### A scale model of a building is 8 inches wide and 27 inches tall. It is placed against a wall. What is the length of the shortest pole that will reach the wall above it from the level ground?

Use trigonometry it is easier to get $CG = \dfrac{8}{cos \alpha} + \dfrac{27}{sin \alpha}$, it gets minimum value when

 $\dfrac{8 sin \alpha}{cos^2 \alpha}- \dfrac{27 cos \alpha}{sin^2 \alpha}=0 \implies tan \alpha=\dfrac{3}{2} \implies CG_{min}=\boxed{13\sqrt{13}}$

Note: to avoid trigonometrical approach, it would be a hard work to solve this problem, seems.
