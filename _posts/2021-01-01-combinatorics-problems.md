#### Aaron and Brooke are playing a game where a fair coin is being flipped repeatedly. If 4 heads in a row are ever flipped, the game ends and Aaron wins. If 3 tails in a row are ever flipped, the game ends and Brooke wins. What is the probability that Aaron wins?

**Solution:**

This problem is a more general format of Penney's Game, with different lengths of sequences that two players choose. John Horton Conway's algorithm can be used for this type of problems, with sequences of dissimilar length.

> Here is a general description of Conway's algorithm:
>
> (1) Given two sequences $A$ and $B$, the leading numbers give us a way of working out the odds of sequence $B$.

> (2.2) Compare two sequences, put 1 above the first digit of the upper sequence of equal, 0 otherwise
>
> (2.3) Remove the leading digit from the upper sequence and shift it to the left. Then repeat step (II) to get next digit, and so on.
>
> (3) Write $AA$ for the binary format of leading number we get using sequence $A$ as the upper and lower sequence. $AB$ for the binary format of leading number we get using sequence $A$ has the upper sequence and sequence $B$ as the lower sequence, and so on.
>
> The odds of sequence $B$ winning are given by the equation $\dfrac{AA-AB}{BB-BA}$.

Apply Conway's algorithm to this problem:

$A=HHHH, B=TTT$

The binary leading number of $AA$ is 1111, the binary leading number of $AB$ is 0000, the binary leading number of $BB$ is 111, and the binary leading number of $BA$ is 000.

So the odds of $B$ winning is given by $\dfrac{1111-0000}{111-000}=\dfrac{15}{7}$

This means the probability that Aaron wins is $\dfrac{7}{15+7}=\boxed{\dfrac{7}{22}}$.

#### An ant starts at the point $(1, 0)$. Each minute, it walks from its current position to one of the four adjacent lattice points until it reaches a point $(x, y)$ with $|x| + |y| \ge 2$. What is the probability that the ant ends at the point $(1, 1)?$ *HMMT 2010 General Test Problem 4*

**Solutions:**

1. From $(1, 0)$ there are $\dfrac{1}{4}$ of probability that the ant goes to point $(1, 1)$, $\dfrac{1}{4}$ of probability that the ant goes to point $(2, 0)$ and $\dfrac{1}{4}$ of probability that the ant goes to point $(-1, 0)$ such that the ant will not return back, and  $\dfrac{1}{4}$ of probability that the ant goes to point $(0, 0)$, which we let it to be $p$. So the asked probability is $\dfrac{1}{4} + \dfrac{1}{4}p$.

2. Now we calculate the probability of the ant from $(0, 0)$ to point $(1, 1)$. There are eight border points at which the ant will stop, and they are divided into two groups: $(2, 0), (0, 2), (-2, 0), (0, -2)$ (they have the same probability to be reached by the ant starting from $(0, 0)$, and let this probability to be $p_1$), and $(1, 1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, -1)$ (they have the same probability to be reached by the ant starting from $(0, 0)$, and let this probability to be $p_2$). Easy to see that the ant has only one path of distance 2 to get to the points in the first group, while it has two paths of distance 2 to get to the points in the second group. That means $p_2=2p_1$. And we know the sum of probabilities of all the points in both group is $1$, so $4p_1+4p_2=1, p_2=2p_1 \implies p_2=\dfrac{1}{6}, p_1=\dfrac{1}{12}$.

3. So the asked probability is $\dfrac{1}{4}(\dfrac{1}{6}+1)=\boxed{\dfrac{7}{24}}$.
