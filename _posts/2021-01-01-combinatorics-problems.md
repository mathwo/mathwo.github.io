#### Aaron and Brooke are playing a game where a fair coin is being flipped repeatedly. If 4 heads in a row are ever flipped, the game ends and Aaron wins. If 3 tails in a row are ever flipped, the game ends and Brooke wins. What is the probability that Aaron wins?

**Solution:**

<!--$P(H) = \dfrac{1}{8} + P(T) * \dfrac{7}{8}$

$P(T) = \dfrac{3}{4} * P(H)$
-->
