#### Aaron and Brooke are playing a game where a fair coin is being flipped repeatedly. If 4 heads in a row are ever flipped, the game ends and Aaron wins. If 3 tails in a row are ever flipped, the game ends and Brooke wins. What is the probability that Aaron wins?

**Solution:**

John Horton Conway's algorithm can be used for sequences of dissimilar length.

Apply Conway's algorithm to this problem:

$A=HHHH, B=TTT$

The binary leading number of $AA$ is 1111, the binary leading number of $AB$ is 0000, the binary leading number of $BB$ is 111, and the binary leading number of $BA$ is 000.

So the odds of $B$ winning is given by $\dfrac{1111-0000}{111-000}=\dfrac{15}{7}$

This means the probability that Aaron wins is $\dfrac{7}{15+7}=\boxed{\dfrac{7}{22}}$.
