## AIME Class 1 - Function

## Fun Question

### A person started climbing a mountain at 7am. He followed a narrow trail leading to the top. He arrived the summit at 7pm. The next day he started back down at 7am and reached the bottom at 7pm. Prove that there is a spot on the trail that he passed at the same time as the day before. The person walked in random speed even stopped to rest sometime.

**Prove:**

Consider the graph of distance from the bottom of the mountain vs the time. The first day in green. The second day in red.

So the first day he started from $A$ and end up at $B$. The second day he started from $C$ and end up at $D$. It is evident these two curves have to intersect. The intersection is the spot the question talked about.

This is called Fixed Point Theorem (Brouwer 1912). 

Interesting puzzles:

(1) If you put a map of the United States on the ground inside the United States, then there is always a point $A$ on the map that is exactly above the point on the ground where point $A$ is representing.

(2) If you have a shallow box and a piece of paper exactly covers the bottom of the box, image that every point on the paper is paired with a point directly beneath it on the bottom of the box. Pick up the paper, crumple it into a ball, and drop it back in the box. Topologists have proved that no matter how the paper is crumpled or where is falls in the box, there must be at least one point on the paper that is directly above its corresponding point on the box.

(3) No matter how much you stir a cup of coffee, some point of the liquid will return to its original position. That is, assuming that none of the liquid was spilled.

(4) At every instant, there is at least one spot on the Earth where no wind is blowing.



## What is a function

### A function related an input to an output. For every input in the domain, there is one one output.

### Graphing Functions

1. Graph of function $y=f(x+k)$ can be found by moving graph of $y=f(x)$ left $k$ units (if $k<0$, then we are moving to the right)
2. Graph of function $y=f(x)+h$ can be found by moving graph of $y=f(x)$ up $h$ units (if $h<0$, then we are moving down)
3. Graph of function $y=f(x+h)+h$ can be found by moving graph of $y=f(x)$ left $k$ units and up $h$ units
4. Graph of function $y=-f(x)$ can be found by reflecting graph of $y=f(x)$ over the $x$-axis
5. Graph of function $y=f(-x)$ can be found by reflecting graph of $y=f(x)$ over the $y$-axis
6. Graph of function $y=-f(-x)$ can be found by reflecting graph of $y=f(x)$ over the origin point
7. Graph of function $y=f^{-1}(x)$ can be found by reflecting graph of $y=f(x)$ over the line $y=x$
8. Graph of function $y=|f(x)|$ can be found by reflecting the part of $y=f(x)$ that is below the $x$-axis over the $x$-axis
