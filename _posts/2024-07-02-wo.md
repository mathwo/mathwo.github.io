#### $I$ is the incenter of $$\triangle{ABC}$$ and $$D,E,F$$ are the touch points of incircle on side $BC, CA, AB$ respectively. $\odot{AEF} \cap \odot{ABC}=K (K \ne A), AK \cap BC=T$, prove that $AI \perp TI$

**Prove:**

$$
\begin{multline}
\shoveleft AT \text{ is the radical axis of }\odot{AKFIE} \text{ and } \odot{ABC}\\
\shoveleft BC \text{ is the radical axis of }\odot{BIC} \text{ and } \odot{ABC}\\
\shoveleft \implies T \text{ is the radical center of three circles }\\
\shoveleft \text{By properties of incenter configuration, the center of }\odot{BIC}\\
\shoveleft \text{is the midpoint of arc }\overset{\huge\frown}{BC} \text{ of } \odot{ABC} \text{ which does not contain }A\\
\shoveleft \implies I=\odot{AKFIE} \cap \odot{BIC} \implies TI \perp AI \blacksquare
\end{multline}

#### Note:

- $$K$$ is called **Shaky-Devil point** on [Lemmas in Olympiad Geometry](https://www.awesomemath.org/product/lemmas-in-olympiad-geometry/) from [Evan Chen's EGMO page](https://web.evanchen.cc/geombook.html)
- There is a six-part detailed introduction to [Incenter-Related Configurations](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c776104h1953548) on an AOPS community blog but in bad format. I am going to make a clean format of it.
