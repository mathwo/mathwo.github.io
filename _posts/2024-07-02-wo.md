#### $I$ is the incenter of $\triangle{ABC}$ and $D,E,F$ are the touch points of incircle on side $BC, CA, AB$ respectively. $\odot{AEF} \cap \odot{ABC}=K (K \ne A), AK \cap BC=T$, prove that $AI \perp TI$

$$
\begin{multline}
\shoveleft AT \text{ is the radical axis of }\odot{AKFIE} \text{ and } \odot{ABC}\\
\shoveleft BC \text{ is the radical axis of }\odot{BIC} \text{ and } \odot{ABC}\\
\shoveleft \implies T \text{ is the radical center of three circles }\\
\shoveleft \text{By properties of incenter configuration, the center of }\odot{BIC}\\
\shoveleft \text{is the midpoint of arc }\overset{\huge\frown}{BC} \text{ of } \odot{ABC} \text{ which does not contain }A\\
\shoveleft \implies I=\odot{AKFIE} \cap \odot{BIC} \implies TI \perp AI \blacksquare

#### Note:

- $K$ is called **Shaky-Devil point** on [Lemmas in Olympiad Geometry](https://www.awesomemath.org/product/lemmas-in-olympiad-geometry/) from [Evan Chen's EGMO page](https://web.evanchen.cc/geombook.html)
- There is a six-part detailed introduction to [Incenter-Related Configurations](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c776104h1953548) on an AOPS community blog but in bad format. I am going to make a clean format of it.

#### Richard and Vanessa are going to play a game of foosball. The first player to score 5 goals wins. Vanessa is better: at any given point she is $60\%$ likely to score the next goal. What is the probability that Richard wins?

**Solve:**
$$
\begin{multline}
\shoveleft \text{Richard will win when he has got 4 goals and will score the next goal.}\\
\shoveleft \text{Consider how many goals has Vanessa got now, here is the case work:}\\
\shoveleft \begin{cases}
\text{case 1: Vanessa goals = 0, Richard goals = 4: } \displaystyle {4 \choose 0} \times0.6^0 \times 0.4^4 \times 0.4\\
\text{case 2: Vanessa goals = 1, Richard goals = 4: } \displaystyle {5 \choose 1} \times 0.6^1\times 0.4^4 \times 0.4\\
\text{case 3: Vanessa goals = 2, Richard goals = 4: } \displaystyle {6 \choose 2} \times 0.6^2 \times 0.4^4 \times 0.4\\
\text{case 4: Vanessa goals = 3, Richard goals = 4: } \displaystyle {7 \choose 3} \times 0.6^3 \times 0.4^4 \times 0.4\\
\text{case 5: Vanessa goals = 4, Richard goals = 4: } \displaystyle {8 \choose 4} \times 0.6^4 \times 0.4^4 \times 0.4\\
\end{cases}\\
\shoveleft \implies \sum(cases)=0.26656768 \approx \bbox[5px, border: 1px solid black]{26.66\%}
\end{multline}\\

#### In the card game bridge, each of 4 players is dealt a hand of 13 of the 52 cards. What is the probability that each player receives exactly one Ace?

**Solve 1:**
$$
\begin{multline}
\shoveleft \text{Suppose the }52 \text{ cards have been numbered such that 1-13, 14-26, 27-39, 40-52 cards}\\
\shoveleft \text{will be in the hand of the first, second, third and fourth player respectively}\\
\shoveleft \text{but the order of cards in the hand of each player does not matter.}\\
\shoveleft \text{Without losing of generality, we suppose the first Ace has been assigned to the first player}\\
\shoveleft \text{and be numbered as 1st card. Now consider the second Ace card: }\\
\shoveleft \text{It could be numbered from 2-52, and if it is numbered from 14-52,}\\
\shoveleft \text{ it is not in the hand of the first player. So it has probability of }\dfrac{52-13}{52-1}\\
\shoveleft \text{ to be not in the hand of the same player.}\\
\shoveleft \text{Then consider the third Ace card, it could be numbered from 3-52, and there are 26 numbers}\\
\shoveleft \text{ will guarantee it is not in the hand of any player who already owns an Ace card, which means }\\
\shoveleft \text{ the probability is }\dfrac{52-26}{52-2}. \text{ Similarly, the probability of the fourth Ace card is not in the hand}\\
\shoveleft \text{ of any player who already owns an Ace card is }\dfrac{52-39}{52-3}. \text{So the total probability is}\\
\shoveleft \dfrac{39}{51}\times\dfrac{26}{50}\times\dfrac{13}{49}=\dfrac{13^3}{17*35^2}=\dfrac{2197}{20825} \approx \bbox[5px, border: 1px solid black]{0.1055}\\
\end{multline}
$$
**Solve 2:**
$$
\begin{multline}
\shoveleft \text{Suppose the }52 \text{ cards have been numbered such that 1-13, 14-26, 27-39, 40-52 cards}\\
\shoveleft \text{will be in the hand of the first, second, third and fourth player respectively}\\
\shoveleft \text{And we suppose that the order of cards in the hand of each player matters.}\\
\shoveleft \text{This will make the counting easier: the total ways to arrange the 52 cars is }52!\\
\shoveleft \text{There are }4! \text{ ways to assign 4 Ace cards to each player}\\
\shoveleft \text{And for each Ace card, it can be placed as any of the 13 cards that player owns,}\\
\shoveleft \text{this means }13^4 \text{ ways to place the 4 Ace cards to the list to each player}\\
\shoveleft \text{then there are }48!\text{ ways to arrange the rest }48 \text{ cards to the list}\\
\shoveleft \text{So the total probability is }\dfrac{4! \times 13^4 \times 48!}{52!}=\dfrac{13^3}{17*35^2}=\dfrac{2197}{20825} \approx \bbox[5px, border: 1px solid black]{0.1055}\approx 10.55\%
\end{multline}
$$
**Note:**

- The probability that 4 Ace cards are in the same player (4-0-0-0): 

  $\dfrac{\displaystyle{4 \choose 1} \times P^{13}_{4}\times 48!}{52!}=\dfrac{44}{4165}=\dfrac{220}{20825} \approx 0.01056 \approx 1.06\%$

  $20825-2197-220=18408$

  **Note:** $\dfrac{12}{51} \times \dfrac{11}{50} \times \dfrac{10}{49}$ is also correct, but hard to get results in following cases.

- The probability that 2 out of 4 players get 2 Ace cards each (2-2-0-0):
  
  $\dfrac{\displaystyle{4 \choose 2} \times 4! {13 \choose 2}^2 \times 48!}{52!}=\dfrac{2808}{20825} \approx 0.1348 \approx 13.48\%$
  
  $18408-2808=15600$
  
- The probability that 1 player gets 2 Ace cards, another 2 players get 1 Ace card each (2-1-1-0):

  $\dfrac{\displaystyle {4 \choose 3} \times {3 \choose 1} \times 4! \times 13^2 \times {13 \choose 2}\times 48!}{52!}=\dfrac{12168}{20825}\approx 0.5843 \approx 58.43\%$

  $15600-12168=3432$

- The probability that one player gets 3 Ace cards, another 1 player gets the rest 1 Ace card (3-1-0-0):
  $\dfrac{P^4_2 \times 4! \times 13 \times \displaystyle{13 \choose 3 } \times 48!}{52!}=\dfrac{3432}{20825} \approx 0.1648 \approx 16.48\%$
