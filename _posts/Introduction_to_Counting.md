## Introduction to Counting

### Chapter 1 - Counting is Arithmetic

#### Counting Lists of Numbers: how many items in a list -- build an index list starting from 1

#### Counting with Addition and Subtraction: Venn diagram

#### Counting Multiple Events: Problem -> multiply: the number of ways that $A$ and $B$ can occur is:

#### (The number of ways $A$ can occur)  times (the number of ways $B$ can occur)

* Permutation
* Factorial

#### Permutations

* The number of permutations of size $r$ from a group of $n$ objects: $P(n, r)=\dfrac{n!}{(n-r)!}$

* Property: $P(n, k)  \cdot P(n-k, j)=P(n, k_j)$

### Chapter 2 - Basic Counting Techniques

#### Casework

#### Complementary Counting

#### Constructive Counting

#### Counting with Restrictions

### Chapter 3 - Correcting for Overcounting - strategic overcounting

#### Counting Pairs of Items

#### Counting with Symmetries

#### $1+2+...+(n-1)+n=\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}$



 ### Chapter 4 - Committees and Combinations

#### Committee Forming

#### How to Compute Combinations

#### $ \displaystyle C(n,r)=nC_r={n \choose r}=\dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$

#### $\displaystyle {n \choose r}={n \choose n-r}$
